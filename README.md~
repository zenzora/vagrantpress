This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  
The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (Thereâ€™s only master branch.)
2. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater` from command line
2. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory
3. Open your browser to http://vagrantpress.dev

## Working with the environment

To log in to the local Wordpress installation:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/wp-admin/` the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

You can access phpMyAdmin:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/phpmyadmin/` with username `wordpress`, password `wordpress`.
